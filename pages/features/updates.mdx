# Updates

## Shares and Loot

- Both shares (economic and voting rights) and loot (economic rights only) are now ERC-20 tokens
- This creates full composability and compatibility with ERC20-based apps and protocols (E.g. token-gating, etc.)
- The DAO can toggle on or off transferability for shares and loot independently (off = permissioned DAO a la Moloch V2)
- Full support for vote delegation a la Compound Governor
- Full support for vote with signature a la Compound Governor

## Shamans and Extensibility

- Shamans are external contracts that the DAO can approve for special permissions
- Manager shamans can mint/burn shares and loot without a DAO proposal -- this enables a brand new design space for DAO formation and governance (trustless onboarding, share staking, and much more)
- Governor shamans can adjust governance parameters with out a DAO proposal (see below)
- Admin Shamans can toggle share/loot transferability without a DAO proposal

## Governance Parameters

- All governance parameters are now adjustable by the DAO (via proposal)
- Also adjustable by a governor shaman, if established by the DAO

## Flexible Proposals

- Moloch v3 proposals have arbitrary execution, which means they can interact with any smart contract
- This means that DAOs no longer have to move funds into a Minion (breaking ragequit) in order to take, say, DeFi actions
- Proposals are multi-send compatible, which means multiple actions can be stacked together into a single proposal

## Gnosis Safe

- Using the Zodiac pattern, a Moloch v3 DAO can use a Gnosis Safe as its treasury
- Supports all on-chain assets, including ERC-20, ERC-721, ERC-1155, veTokens, native coins, etc.
- Enables compatibility with all of the Safe-based apps and tools
- Facilitates easy "upgrade" from a multisig to a DAO
- Migrate to another DAO framework without moving funds

## Advanced Ragequit

- Share- and loot-holders can now choose which tokens they want to receive when ragequitting
- Removes the need for the DAO to approve (n√©e "whitelist") tokens before receiving/spending them

## Additional Features

- Add an option for a proposal sponsor to vote yes along with their sponsorship
- DAO can use an external contract as its ragequittable treasury
