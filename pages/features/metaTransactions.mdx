# Meta Transactions

Meta transactions can allow a trusted party to pay for users gas. 
This can lower the barrier to entry and allow more seamless integrations with other apps.

THe DAO, through proposal, can update the trusted forwarder. 
If the trusted forwarder is the zero address 
it will work like normal without meta transactions enabled.

## Best Practice

A malicious trusted forwarder could be used to spoof the account of any DAO member.
Because of this special care should be used when enabling this feature. 
A bad trusted forwarder or a modifiable one could.

Special note:
the trusted forwarder can be updated through DAO proposal or a governor Shaman.
