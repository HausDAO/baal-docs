# Meta Transactions

Meta transactions can allow a trusted party to pay for users gas.
This can lower the barrier to entry and allow more seamless integrations with other apps.

The DAO, through proposal, can update the trusted forwarder.
If the trusted forwarder is the **zero address**
it will work like normal without meta transactions enabled.

## Best Practice

A malicious trusted forwarder (or a modifiable one) could be used to spoof the account of any DAO member. Because of this
special care should be used when enabling this feature.

### Special Note:

The trusted forwarder address can be updated through DAO proposal or a governor Shaman.
