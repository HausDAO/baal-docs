# Get Started With Baal

This getting started guide is for using Baal. However, for some specific documentation we'll be referring to the

The general setup steps come from the core [Mystics GitHub Baal Repository](https://github.com/Moloch-Mystics/Baal)

## Interfaces Supported

[ERC-20](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-20)

> Baal shares are pausable, fungible tokens. Non-conformant tokens can also be handled by Baal by implementing `safeTransfer/From()`.

[EIP-2612](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2612)

> Baal shares support EIP-712-style approvals by implementing `permit()`, allowing pulls in a single transaction and 'gas' to be paid in tokens (including Baal shares), abstracting the need to hold ETH.

[ERC-721](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721)

> Baal is a 'safe' receiver of NFTs by implementing `onERC721Received()`.

[ERC-1155](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1155)

> Baal is a 'safe' receiver of tokens issued under 'multi-token' contracts by implementing `onERC1155Received()` and `onERC1155BatchReceived()`.

[ERC-3156](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-3156)

> Tokens held in Baal can be flash lent for an amendable fee by implementing `flashLoan()`. This feature can be turned on and off.
