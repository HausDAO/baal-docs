## Admin Locks

The Shaman roles that are used to update configuration can be locked.

The DAO can permenetily lock special rights that could be given to Shamans (for example, permanently disable Governor/Admin/Manager Shamans)

```
    /// @notice Lock admin so setShamans cannot be called with admin changes
    function lockAdmin() external baalOnly {
        adminLock = true;
    }

    /// @notice Lock manager so setShamans cannot be called with manager changes
    function lockManager() external baalOnly {
        managerLock = true;
    }

    /// @notice Lock governor so setShamans cannot be called with governor changes
    function lockGovernor() external baalOnly {
        governorLock = true;
    }
```
