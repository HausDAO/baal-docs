## Admin Locks

The Shaman roles that are used to update configuration can be locked.

The DAO can permenetily lock special rights that could be given to Shamans (for example, permanently disable Governor/Admin/Manager Shamans)

```js
    function lockAdmin() external baalOnly {
        adminLock = true;
    }

    function lockManager() external baalOnly {
        managerLock = true;
    }

    function lockGovernor() external baalOnly {
        governorLock = true;
    }
```
