### Kovan

- **[TributeMinion](https://kovan.etherscan.io/address/0xcC3fE4c9F976167db373DEe88EB9b0E1Dc834c6B)**: `0xcC3fE4c9F976167db373DEe88EB9b0E1Dc834c6B`

## Create Tribute Proposal

1. Make a `submitTributeProposal` function call to the TributeMinion contract

```js
function submitTributeProposal(
    Baal baal,
    address token,
    uint256 amount,
    uint256 shares,
    uint256 loot,
    uint32 expiration,
    string memory details
)
```

- `msg.sender` is member tributing/requesting shares/loot
- `baal` is the DAO we are tributing too
- `token` - ERC-20 `tokenAddress`
- `amount` of tribute, `shares`, `loot` in Wei
- `expiration` is epoch time, same as in baal `submitProposal`
- `details` - proposal details schema we use

2. `TributeMinion` contract encodes ERC-20 token transfers and makes the proposal against the baal contract
3. Subgraph catches the normal `submitProposal` event to create proposal entity
4. TributeMinion emits additional event that we catch and add the following fields to the proposal entity:
   - `tributeOffered`
   - `tributeToken`
   - `tributeTokenSymbol`
   - `tributeTokenDecimals`
   - `tributeMinionRecipient`
