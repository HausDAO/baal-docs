## Minion Patern

The Minion pattern was relevant in Moloch V2. It worked as a proposal 'shim' to allow execution of arbitrary contract execution. An action could be stored in the external minion contract that could only be executed on successfull passing of a proposal. THis allowed more advanced DAOs with multiple treasuries (Safes). Because multicall and execution is now built into Baal this pattern of a proposal wrapper is no longer needed.

But there is still interesting use cases for a proposal wrapper pattern. THis can be seen in the Tribute Minion.
