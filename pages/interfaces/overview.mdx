# Overview

## Interfaces Supported

[ERC-20](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-20)

> Baal shares and loot are pausable, fungible tokens. Non-conformant tokens can also be handled by Baal by implementing `safeTransfer/From()`.

[EIP-2612](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2612)

> Baal shares support EIP-712-style approvals by implementing `permit()`, allowing pulls in a single transaction and 'gas' to be paid in tokens (including Baal shares), abstracting the need to hold ETH.

[eip-1167](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1167)

> Minimal Proxy Contract

[GNosis Zodiac](https://github.com/gnosis/zodiac)

> A composable design philosophy for DAOs, [Zodiac](https://gnosisguild.mirror.xyz/OuhG5s2X5uSVBx1EK4tKPhnUc91Wh9YM0fwSnC8UNcg) is a collection of tools built according to an open standard

## SharesToken.sol

- ERC20 openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/ERC20.sol
- minimal clone proxy eip-1167
- Ownable by baal
- Initializable openzeppelin/contracts/proxy/utils/Initializable.sol - for setup by baal
- delegation management similar to comp
- before transfer override: Allows transfers if msg.sender is Baal which enables minting and burning, move delegates and self delegate


External delegation functions

```
function delegate(address delegatee) external
function delegateBySig(
        address delegatee,
        uint256 nonce,
        uint256 deadline,
        bytes calldata signature
    ) external 

```

Events

```
event DelegateVotesChanged(
    address indexed delegate, 
    uint previousBalance, 
    uint newBalance
);
event DelegateChanged(
    address indexed delegator, 
    address indexed fromDelegate, 
    address indexed toDelegate
);
event Transfer(
    address indexed from, 
    address indexed to, 
    uint256 amount
);

```
