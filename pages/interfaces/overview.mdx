# Overview

## Interfaces Supported

[ERC-20](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-20)

> Baal shares and loot are pausable, fungible tokens. Non-conformant tokens can also be handled by Baal by implementing `safeTransfer/From()`.

[EIP-2612](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2612)

> Baal shares support EIP-712-style approvals by implementing `permit()`, allowing pulls in a single transaction and 'gas' to be paid in tokens (including Baal shares), abstracting the need to hold ETH.
