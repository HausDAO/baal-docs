# Baal ðŸ‘º

## Meet Baal

_Baal sets the season, and gives forth His voice from the clouds._

*There was a time when humanity mistakenly assumed that we were at battle against each other. Then, the original Moloch DAO contract made us aware that the enemy is Moloch, the demon god of coordination failure.* 

*Moloch v2 helped us to begin efforts of working together to solve the problems that affect all of humanity. Baal is Moloch v3 and offers more tools to improve these efforts.*

*Your skills at wielding a pair of battle axes have improved. It is now time to test your courage.  Moloch is a worthy foe.  Aim for the head.*

Much of this section is from the Moloch [Mystics GitHub Baal Repository](https://github.com/Moloch-Mystics/Baal)

This is the most recent collaborative repository for Moloch V3, codename Baal. (Jan 13, 2022). This message will change when the repository is depricated.

Baal is a minimal yet composable DAO template continuing work from the Moloch, Minion and Compound frameworks to make it easier for people to combine and command crypto assets with intuitive membership games.
