## About Baal

_Baal sets the season, and gives forth His voice from the clouds._

Much of this section is from the Moloch [Mystics GitHub Baal Repository](https://github.com/Moloch-Mystics/Baal)

This is the most recent collaborative repository for Moloch V3, codename Baal. (Jan 13, 2022). This message will change when the repository is depricated.

Baal is a minimal yet composable DAO template continuing work from the Moloch, Minion and Compound frameworks to make it easier for people to combine and command crypto assets with intuitive membership games.
